            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>For the Reputation of the Bills.</head>
               <p n="1">I. The Certainty and Unalienableneſs of the Fund appropriated to the Payment of the ſaid Bills.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:39782:2"/> II. There are many eminent Traders that have already engaged, under their Hands, to Accept the ſaid Bills in all Payments; and numbers more than have promis'd to do the ſame, if deſired.</p>
               <p n="3">III. When Tallies are turn'd into Ten Pound Bills of Credit, as aforeſaid, leſt any Perſon ſhould (after all theſe Publick Advantages) ſcruple to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſaid Bills, there are Perſons of good Eſtates that will, within Six Months, publiſh and declare where there ſhall be a ſufficient Summ of Money provided to give out in Exchange for all their Bills, and to the full Value (the Six Months Intereſt only excepted) provided they ſhall not be Taxed for the ſaid Money.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Bank Bills, and Million Lottery Tickets, or New Mill'd Money, may exactly be Counterfeited; but there is a Way alſo invented to make theſe Bills of Credit ſo, that it will be impoſſible for any Perſon to Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit them.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Benefit of theſe Bills.</head>
               <p n="1">I. Whereas now the Nation pays, for every 50 Pound, Principal and Intereſt, at 8 <hi>per Cent.</hi> in 10 Years 90 Pound. Hereby we pay off Principal and Intereſt, with—73 <hi>l.</hi> 15 <hi>s.</hi> And ſo we ſave, in 10 Years, in every 50 Pound — 16 <hi>l.</hi> 05 <hi>s.</hi> Whereby we plainly ſee how great a Benefit this will be to the Subjects: For 325000 Pound will be ſaved in every Million in 10 Years, and we have the Advantage of Trading with the Whole; for theſe Bills will ſupply the want of Coin, and anſwer all the Uſes of it; whereby the Diſcouragement our Traders and others are at preſent under, will be removed; and without which, the Ready Caſh of the Nation is inſufficient to ſupport our Trade.</p>
               <p n="2">II. This eaſeth the Nation, and there is no occaſion to make an <hi>Act,</hi> That thoſe Bills ſhall paſs Current in Payment. For it is the Opinion of many Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Traders, That ſo ſoon as theſe Propoſals are Read and Approv'd of by this Honourable Houſe, before the <hi>Act</hi> is Paſt, the Diſcount upon Tallies and Bank Bills will fall; and when the <hi>Act</hi> is Paſt, and Tallies turn'd into Bills of Credit, although there ſhould be no Money provided to exchange the ſaid Bills, as aforeſaid, they will be as Current, and more deſirable than Ready Money, as may be made appear by many that have and are willing to ſet their Hands to the <hi>Propoſal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. All the remaining Tallies not included in theſe propoſed Bills, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come reputable, ſeeing one Moiety is taken out, whereby the Yearly Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe remaining will be eaſier, the Proſpect of ſuch Payments more encouraging; yea, this certain Payment of one half, will inſenſibly gain an Eſteem of all Publick Securities.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Many will preferr theſe Bills to Ready Money, and buy them, becauſe of the Intereſt growing daily thereupon; the Eaſineſs of their Carriage, Safety in Poſſeſſing them, Prevention of the Trouble of Counting, and Loſs by Falſe Money. But the Advantages are ſo obvious, as well as great and many, that a Hint is ſufficient to all Men of Thought.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The ruinous Trade of Buying and Selling of Bank Bills and Tallies will be at an end; Taxes eaſily paid; the Bank, and all them who by the Bad Money, or otherwiſe, have their Eſtates lodged in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> be relieved, who are now diſabled from paying their Debts, and managing their Trade, unleſs they ſell their Tallies by a Diſcount of 30, 40, or 50 <hi>per Cent.</hi> which would be the utter ruine of the greateſt Number; and without ſelling them, they ſerve to no uſe, either to the Publick or themſelves: For it is not 8 <hi>per Cent.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt that will ſupport Traders Families, or manage their Trade, as we daily ſee by the Failing of many who have Stocks in thoſe Tallies.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:39782:2"/>
               <p> It may alſo be added, That there may be more than 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> allowed for ſome of the firſt Years, and leſs in the following, either with little Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Diminution in the Payment of the Intereſt, as appears by theſe Two different Schemes:
